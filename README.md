## Where am I?

Hi there! If you're here, probably **you have some free time this weekend and you want to learn something new**. Exactly what happened to me, but I wasn't that lucky: my searches made no good results.

So, I decided to create **a list of things that I could learn in a weekend**!

## I want to contribute!

Glad to hear that! Take a look to the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Many other developers [already added something](https://github.com/francescomalatesta/weekend-learning/graphs/contributors)!

As you [can see on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), these principles are the very basics of good code in object oriented programming. Nothing really complicated by the way, so choose your favourite language and learn them!*;
- **_Learn a Design Pattern_**: *design patterns are recurring solutions for common problem in software design. If you don't know them, you can easily [find the book with a search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Design+Patterns%3A+Elements+of+Reusable+Object-Oriented+Software) and study a couple of them every weekend. If you don't want to buy the book, don't worry: internet is full of articles about them.*;
- **_Learn Test driven development (TDD)_**: *is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. [See more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).*;

#### Protocols

- **_OAuth2_**: *OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization. It's used to log users into third party services without exposing sensible credentials, like passwords. This [article on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) is a very good overview on the subject, and the [OAuth2 Framework specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) describes everything in depth.*;

#### PHP

- **Frameworks**
  - **_Learn Laravel Basics_**: *Laravel is a widely used PHP full stack framework that you can use to build a project in a very short time. Sometimes in a weekend. The [Basic Task List](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/quickstart) page in the documentation can be a perfect start.*;

- **ORM**
  - **_Learn the basics of Doctrine ORM_**: *Doctrine is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for PHP 5.4+ that provides transparent persistence for PHP objects. It uses the Data Mapper pattern at the heart, aiming for a complete separation of your domain/business logic from the persistence in a relational database management system. Look at [this getting started](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started.html) for a first overview.*;

#### Javascript

- **NodeJS**
  - **_Beginner Overview on NodeJS_**: *Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. You probably have seen many articles and sites, here and there on the web, talking about it. I have found [this really good introductory article](http://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginner-splurge-in-node-js/) to move your first steps in this world*;
  - **_Beginner Guide on NPM_**: *npm is the NodeJS tool used to install and manage dependencies. You can use to install packages both locally (for a specific project) and globally (making it available to the entire system). [This article on Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/) is a nice starter to explore it.*;
  - **_Practice with NodeJS technologies_**: *You can learn Node.js and similar javascript technologies through interactive exercises by simply installing workshops using npm. All the information to do that are in the official site  [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/).*;
- **ReactJS**
  - **_Beginner Overview on ReactJS_**: *React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the V in MVC. ReactJS was born to building large applications with data that changes over time. The Facebook Getting Started is great to begin [Facebook Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html). Also [Facebook Guides](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html) are great.*;
  - **_ReactJS How To_**: *ReactJS is just a "UI Components builder", but it alone is useless. A great resource to study his ecosystem is [Pete Hunt's ReactJS How To](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto)*;

#### Tools

- **Fundamentals**
  - **_Git_**: *Git is the actual standard for source code versioning. It's like saving your game and resume it from the last checkpoint if something goes wrong... [try this nice start guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/), you'll never go back!*;
- **Emails**:
  - **_MJML_**: *[MJML](http://www.mjml.io) is a templating engine by the fine folks at mailjet.com, built on React.js.

- **Virtualization**
  - **_Docker_**: *Docker is an awesome tool that you can use to wrap your application in many isolated units, called "containers", and quickly deploy them everywhere. It's like virtualization, but without hardware/os virtualization. That's why it's one of the most used solution nowadays. [This video series](https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training) (just ~3hrs) can give you a nice overview of the thing.*;

#### Miscellaneous

- **_Learn Markdown_**: *Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed to be converted to HTML. It's often used for readme files. This list is written in Markdown! [The official specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) can be a good start to learn it.*;
